# macos-desktop-environment

My desktop environment configuration
- Sketchybar as a menu bar replacement
- Jankyborders for highlighting the current window
- ~~Amethyst as a tiling manager~~
- Aerospace as a tiling manager
- Only shows active and focused workspaces (a bit buggy)
- Both compact and normal mode with a GUI toggle
- Aerospace scratchpad

My sketchybar configuratuon is based on [Simple Catppuccin](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/discussions/47?sort=top#discussioncomment-3069564) by [Tnixc](https://github.com/Tnixc) with added plugins for monitoring temperatures.

I made the temperature reading tool tool based on a few different sources, and it can be found here: [macos-temp-tool](https://github.com/Cliffback/macos-temp-tool). It is created specifially for for arm64 / Apple Silicone Macs.

Requires:
- Sketchybar
- Jankyborders
- Aerospace
- Aerospace-scratchpad
